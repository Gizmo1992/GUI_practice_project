# GUI_practice_project
I made this project in order to getting familiar with GUIs.
 I made this program because it was a project in one of my Udemy classes (Total Python: Become an advenced Python developer in 16 days). I followed the project with code along. It is restaurant manger program in order to generate invoices. I'm using invoicing programs in my everyday job as logistics coordinator and it was very interesting to see how these program are made.
